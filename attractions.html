                <h2>The Pyramids</h2>
                <p>The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in 
                    Egypt. Sources cite at least 118 identified "Egyptian" pyramids.
                    Approximately 80 pyramids were built within the Kingdom of Kush,
                    now located in the modern country of Sudan. Of those located in modern Egypt,
                    most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs 
                    and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.

                <h2>Khan Alkhalili</h2>
                <p>Khan el-Khalili (Arabic: خان الخليلي) is a famous bazaar and souq (or souk) in the historic center of Cairo,
                     Egypt. Established as a center of trade in the Mamluk era and named for one of its several historic caravanserais,
                      the bazaar district has since become one of Cairo's main attractions for tourists and Egyptians alike. It is also
                      home to many Egyptian artisans and workshops involved in the production of traditional crafts and souvenirs.
                      The name Khan el-Khalili historically referred to a single building in the area; today it refers to the entire 
                      shopping district.[1]</p>
